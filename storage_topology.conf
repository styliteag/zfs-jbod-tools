# Storage Topology Configuration
# This file defines enclosure mappings and custom disk locations

# Enclosure configuration
# Each enclosure can be identified by either logical_id or id (enclosure number)
enclosures:
  # Example for an internal enclosure
  - id: "500605b0:07459eb0"  # Logical ID from the controller
    name: "Internal"        # Human-readable name
    offset: 100               # Offset to add to the real slot number
    start_slot: 1           # Starting slot number (usually 1)

  # Example for a JBOD enclosure
  - id: "50030480:00a0dabf"  # Logical ID from the controller
    name: "BayFront"      # Human-readable name
    start_slot: 1           # Starting slot number (usually 1)

  # Example for another enclosure with the same logical ID but different enclosure number
  - id: "50030480:009f4fbf"  # Full logical ID including the part after the colon
    name: "BayRear"       # Human-readable name
    start_slot: 25           # Starting slot number (usually 1)

# Custom disk mappings by serial number
# Use this for disks that need special handling
disks:
  # Example of a custom disk mapping
  - serial: "ABCDEF123456"  # Disk serial number
    enclosure: "Custom"     # Custom enclosure name
    slot: 42                # Custom slot number
    disk: 42                # Custom disk number
